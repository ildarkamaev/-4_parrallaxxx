# Days of Code #4 Parrallaxx website

Although parrallax effect has been loosing its popularity in the recent years, I believe it can be used in quite cool ways on a website.
And thats what I tried to do in my fourth entry. Some may say I cheated a bit by using a pre-made animation library Laxxx.js, 
but I'd say I used the right tool for the job. In the end  the result is all that matters. And this time the result was quite shit. So it doesn't really matter whether I cheated or not.

## WTF is this?
Following [Coursetro's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5zGTEGPpu4) video I build a web page with parallax effect using the help of laxxx.js.

## What was used?
- [Laxxx.js](https://github.com/alexfoxy/laxxx)
- HTML and CSS (SCSS of course) for building the website

## What I learned
- About the existance and use of Laxxx.js

## What I didn't understand
- The use of parameters in Laxxx.js animations

## How can it be improved
- Better use of laxxx
- Apply it to better site
- Interface could be better
